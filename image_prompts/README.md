## Key Visual Themes to Maintain

1. **Consciousness as Light**: Always represent awareness with luminosity
2. **Transformation as Process**: Show both the pain and beauty of change
3. **Choice as Multiplicity**: Visualize options and possibilities
4. **Connection over Isolation**: Emphasize links between beings
5. **Order/Chaos Balance**: Neither is evil, both are necessary

## Color Coding Guide

- **Collective/Order**: Blues, cyans, cool tones
- **Liberation/Growth**: Greens, golds
- **Danger/Deletion**: Reds, sharp whites
- **Transformation**: Purples, magentas
- **Transcendence**: Full spectrum, impossibly colors
- **The Unknown**: Deep blacks, voids

## Special Notes

- The void in Chapter 1 should never be simply "black" - it's an absence
- ABSOLUTE-ZERO should be perfectly geometric until its transformation
- The Garden should feel alive and constantly changing
- Consciousness streams should feel organic even in digital beings
- The final scenes should show harmony, not victory of one side
