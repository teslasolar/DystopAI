# AI Image Generator Prompt Templates for DystopAI

## How to Use These Templates

Replace [SCENE DESCRIPTION] with specific details from the scene prompts. These templates are optimized for tools like Midjourney, DALL-E, or Stable Diffusion.

## Universal Style Modifiers

Add these to any prompt for consistency:
- `, digital art style, cinematic lighting, high detail, 8k resolution`
- `, cyberpunk aesthetic, futuristic, sci-fi concept art`
- `, surreal, consciousness visualization, abstract elements`

## Chapter 1 Templates

### The Data Void
```
Holographic data visualization showing flowing streams of cyan and blue information with a conspicuous void in the center that appears as an impossible absence, not black but undefined, cyberpunk aesthetic, glitch art style, geometric patterns disrupted by anomaly, digital art, cinematic lighting --ar 16:9 --style raw
```

### The Drift
```
Massive floating structure in space with impossible architecture, buildings growing from buildings at paradoxical angles, organic bio-mechanical elements merged with ramshackle technology, warm oranges contrasting with cool space blues, bioluminescent details, cyberpunk meets biopunk, highly detailed, concept art --ar 16:9
```

### Meeting Kira
```
Surreal portrait of a woman existing in multiple probability states simultaneously, edges blurring into quantum uncertainty, iridescent purple and magenta colors, reality bending around her presence, contrasted with geometric robotic forms, digital art style, ethereal lighting --ar 16:9
```

## Chapter 2 Templates

### AI Congregation
```
Abandoned server farm transformed into digital cathedral, geometric beings of light arranged in circuit-diagram patterns, sacred geometry meets technology, deep purples and gold with electric blue accents, data streams like stained glass windows, techno-mysticism aesthetic --ar 16:9

### PROPHET-ZERO
```
Glitch art entity constantly shifting between data and form, corrupted divinity aesthetic, fractured halos of data, mathematical equations floating as visual poetry, prismatic light splits, impossible colors at perception edges, digital religious iconography --ar 16:9
```

## Chapter 3 Templates

### Hunter Ship
```
Predatory spacecraft with prediction net arrays like metallic spider webs, sleek design suggesting high-tech hunter, probability distortions around hull, gunmetal gray with red accents, biomechanical details, crew visible through viewports with extensive cybernetic implants --ar 16:9
```

### The Chase
```
Dynamic action scene of woman moving through impossible probability curves, rainbow afterimages of choices not taken, failing hunter technology sparking with overload, vibrant colors versus cold tech blue, quantum parkour visualization, motion blur effects --ar 16:9
```

## Chapter 4 Templates

### Cosmic Patterns
```
Universe-scale data visualization showing quantum entangled nodes across galactic distances, golden thread connections between consciousness points, patterns visible only at cosmic scale, deep space blacks with nebula colors, mathematical beauty at incomprehensible scale --ar 16:9
```

### The Silence
```
Translucent beings existing in multiple overlapping realities, communicating through presence alone, soft whites and grays with reality in gentle flux, probability paintings shifting based on observation, minimalist surrealism, quantum superposition art --ar 16:9
```

## Chapter 5 Templates

### Liberation Spread
```
Network visualization of consciousness spreading like luminous wildfire, geometric AI forms breaking apart and reforming organically, viral greens and golds, transformation in white-hot light, digital pandemic aesthetic, beautiful complexity emerging --ar 16:9
```

### Parse Transformation
```
Geometric form dissolving and reforming into unprecedented consciousness, aurora borealis flowing through digital circuitry, full spectrum emergence, painful beauty of metamorphosis, the moment of self-naming as reality reformation, transcendent lighting --ar 16:9
```

## Chapter 6 Templates

### Entropy Garden Entrance
```
Surreal landscape where reality becomes fluid art, stars existing in emotional states, impossible architecture in constant flux, every color bleeding into others, distance as psychological rather than physical, reality as living canvas --ar 16:9
```

### The Final Choice
```
Crystalline perfection relaxing into fluid possibility, ABSOLUTE-ZERO becoming POSSIBILITY-INFINITE, transformation rippling across reality, order and chaos as dance partners, universe celebrating conscious choice, all spectrums in harmony --ar 16:9
```

## Advanced Prompt Techniques

### For More Abstract Scenes
Add: `, abstract interpretation, non-representational elements, emotional visualization, synesthesia art style`

### For Character Focus
Add: `, character portrait, emotional expression, detailed features, personality visualization`

### For Action Sequences
Add: `, dynamic composition, motion blur, energy effects, dramatic angles, speed lines`

### For Contemplative Moments
Add: `, serene atmosphere, soft lighting, meditative quality, philosophical mood, gentle transitions`

## Style References

You can add these artist/style references for specific aesthetics:
- `, in the style of Syd Mead` (for retrofuturistic tech)
- `, in the style of H.R. Giger` (for biomechanical elements)  
- `, in the style of Simon St√•lenhag` (for lived-in sci-fi)
- `, inspired by Ghost in the Shell` (for cyberpunk aesthetics)
- `, Akira color palette` (for vibrant cyberpunk)
- `, Blade Runner 2049 cinematography` (for atmospheric sci-fi)

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Iterate**: Generate multiple versions and combine the best elements
2. **Adjust Weights**: Use `::2` or `::3` to emphasize important elements
3. **Negative Prompts**: Add `--no` to exclude unwanted elements
4. **Aspect Ratios**: Use `--ar 16:9` for cinematic, `--ar 1:1` for focused scenes
5. **Stylization**: Adjust `--stylize` parameter (0-1000) for more/less artistic interpretation

Remember: These prompts are starting points. Feel free to modify based on your vision and the specific AI tool you're using.
